User Management System

A full-stack application built entirely in TypeScript, featuring a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. The system supports two user roles:

Admin: full CRUD operations for managing user accounts

Standard User: view and update personal profile information

Key Technologies

Backend: Node.js, Express, REST API endpoints

Frontend: React, React Router, Redux

Authentication: Cookie-based (or JWT) with role-based route protection

Database: MongoDB (or your chosen database)

Language: TypeScript across both client and server for type safety

Dual role authentication: Separate access flows for admin and user

Secure, protected routing: Guards ensure users can only access permitted routes

Global state management: Redux manages authentication status and user data

Dynamic interaction: Modal forms for create/edit operations, inline updates without full page refresh

Form validation & error handling: Feedback on both client-side and server-side

Scalable architecture: Modular code structure ideal for future extensions
